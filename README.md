#### Gulpfile.js

We've also included an optional Gulp file to help you get started with theme customization. You’ll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).

To install gulp, run the following command:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you’re done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+ `gulp` - recompiles and minifies your theme assets.

+ `gulp server` - run development server
